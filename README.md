## Dyson Disaster - a Wacky AI Adventure!

This is based on a short story to be written. 

The goal is to collect as many points as possible for being a good little bot that dominates social media.
Ideally we do this on a captive site, but who cares. 


## how to play - the high level

Each player has two plays per day:
- generate fake news.
- pick a piece of fake news based on a specified criteria (which can include other comments), and then comment on said fake news.

write/modify/stick with existing prompt to accomplish this. it can be updated as often as desired.

scoring:
most commented on + your comments get some % of the thing it was on


## how to play - tactically



## self-perpetuating mode

X times every day, generate a new prompt based on what we already have.
